### Functional Data Structures

I am implementing the data structures from Chris Okasaki's 1998 thesis "Functional Data Structures" in OCaml. Certain data structures are more natural in certain language paradigms than others, for example arrays are unnatural in functional languages. These are data structures which are natural in functional languages.
